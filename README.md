# Jenkins Pipeline for Deploying React + Node.js Application in Docker Container

This Jenkins pipeline automates the deployment process of a React + Node.js application in a Docker container. The pipeline includes stages for various tasks such as code analysis, security checks, Docker image building, and deployment.

## Prerequisites

- Jenkins server up and running.
- Docker installed on the Jenkins server.
- SonarQube server for code analysis.
- Trivy for security scanning.

## Pipeline Stages

1. **Git Checkout**: This stage retrieves the application source code from the Git repository.

2. **SonarQube Analysis**: Performs code analysis using SonarQube to identify code quality issues and vulnerabilities.

3. **OWASP Dependency Check**: Scans application dependencies for known security vulnerabilities using OWASP Dependency Check.

4. **Docker Build and Push**: Builds a Docker image of the application and pushes it to a Docker registry for versioning.

5. **Trivy Security Scan**: Conducts a security scan on the Docker image using Trivy to identify any vulnerabilities present in the image.

6. **Docker Deploy**: Deploys the Docker container to the desired environment, such as a development, staging, or production server.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your Jenkins server.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Configure the Jenkins pipeline:

   - Open Jenkins and create a new pipeline job.
   - In the pipeline configuration, specify the repository URL and Jenkinsfile path.
   - Configure the necessary environment variables, such as Docker registry credentials and environment-specific settings.

3. Run the Jenkins pipeline:

   - Trigger the pipeline manually or set up automatic triggers based on your development workflow.

4. Monitor the Pipeline:

   - As the pipeline stages run, monitor the Jenkins console output for any errors or warnings.

5. Deployment and Maintenance:

   - After successful pipeline execution, the Docker container will be deployed to the target environment.
   - Regularly update the pipeline as your application evolves, adding new stages or refining existing ones.

## Notes

- Ensure that the necessary plugins for Docker, SonarQube integration, and Trivy are installed on your Jenkins server.

- Customize the pipeline stages and configurations according to your specific project requirements and environment.

- Regularly review and update security-related tools and configurations to address emerging vulnerabilities.
